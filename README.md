# My Dotfiles

This repo tracks my dotfiles in linux and osx and includes `init.sh`, an automated script for new linux installs (some parts are specific to kde neon) that I usually use off of a flash drive with my os image.

#### both linux and osx
  - `.bash_profile`
  - `.dircolors`
  - `.vimrc`
  - `.git-completion.bash`
  - `.git-config`
  - `ssh/config`

#### linux
  - `bashrc`
  - `init.sh`
  - `PeterFall.colorscheme` (works with konsole)
  - `PeterFall.profile` (works with konsole)

#### osx
  - `Preferences.sublime-settings` (would work in linux but I just use vim)
  - `PeterFall.terminal`
